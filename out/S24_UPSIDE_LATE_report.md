- Late-night mode may require a special exception for midnight-2am alcohol service.
- Last call should be 01:30-01:45 to clear drinks by 02:00.
- Operating after 2am without alcohol is high risk; docs say 24-hour operation is not feasible.

## Notes
- Food COGS and other opex are placeholders; adjust in model/assumptions.yaml before decision-making.
