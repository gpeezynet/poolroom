Poolroom Bar Unit Economics and Operations –
Huntsville, AL
Assumptions Sheet
Pool Table Pricing Ladder: Dynamic pricing boosts table usage. Many pool halls charge lower rates in
off-peak hours and premium rates at night. For example, Bumpers Billiards (Huntsville) uses a flat
daily rate – $8 per person for unlimited play (wristband) on regular nights . Other venues use
hourly rates that rise during peak times: e.g. one pool hall charges ~$10/hour before 6pm vs. $18/
hour in prime evening . Late-night play (post-10pm) is sometimes discounted or offered as a
flat fee to keep players around (Iron City Billiards in Birmingham advertises $5/day unlimited play on
weekdays for 7-ft tables). Memberships are not required in Alabama bars, but some pool halls offer
optional memberships (around $50/year) which grant reduced hourly rates and tournament
discounts . League play is typically through APA – players pay APA’s annual fee (~$25/year) and
nightly match fees (~$8-$10 each) in exchange for free or subsidized table time on league nights
(many hosts waive “green fees” for league matches, viewing it as a driver of drink sales).
Bar COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Targets: Typical beverage margins in Alabama bars align with industry
norms. Beer costs run ~24–28% of sales (i.e. ~72-76% gross margin) . Spirits (liquor) are ~18–20%
pour cost , so cocktails and shots usually target ~20% COGS. In practice, a $5 draft beer might
cost ~$1.25, and a $8 cocktail (1.25 oz liquor + mixer) might cost ~$1.60 in ingredients. Shots of well
liquor often have the lowest cost ratio (15–20% of the price) since they’re straight liquor with no
mixer. Overall, a balanced beverage program should hit ~20% aggregate COGS , leaving ~80%
gross profit to cover other expenses.
Product Mix & Pricing Averages: Local preferences skew toward beer and simple mixed drinks. In
Huntsville’s casual bar scene (and comparable Southern cities), beer is the top seller by volume in
early evening, while spirits (cocktails and shots) become a larger share as the night goes on . For
example, on a Saturday night beer sales peak during dinner hours, then liquor orders (e.g. whiskey,
tequila) dominate late-night rounds . Wine is minimal (~<5% of alcohol sales) in a pool-hall
environment . Pricing: Domestic draft beers average around $4 in Huntsville (craft pints ~$5-6).
Basic mixed drinks (e.g. whiskey cola) run about $6-8, while top-shelf cocktails can be $10-12. Shots
of call spirits (e.g. tequila, bourbon) typically range $4-6, and premium shots (Patrón, etc.) $8+. These
price points yield the COGS percentages above. Notably, late-night crowd preferences (shooters,
straight liquor) often carry higher sticker prices – according to nationwide data, the average drink
price after 11pm is about $9, higher than the ~$8 average earlier in the evening .
Pour Control & Inventory Systems: Mitigating over-pour and spillage is critical for profitability. Many
successful venues install pour control systems – e.g. measured pour spouts, flow meters, or selfpour taps – to ensure consistent 1.25 oz shots and prevent “heavy handed” free-pouring. ROI on
these systems is high: an automated spout system like SkyFlo is proven to cut liquor cost by up to 30%
by eliminating over-pours and unauthorized freebies . In practical terms, a bar selling $20k/

month in alcohol could save ~$4-6k by tightening portion control. Even low-tech measures (jiggers,
staff training) help reduce waste. Many Alabama bar owners consider inventory control services (e.g.
Bar-i, Sculpture Hosp.) that claim 4-7x ROI through reducing shrinkage . We assume our model
bar will implement strict portion controls to target that ~20% liquor COGS and minimize losses.
Average Check – Core Hours: Maximizing spend per guest drives the model. During peak evening
hours (roughly 7pm–10pm), patrons typically stay for multiple drinks and games. We assume an
average spend of ~$25 per customer in core hours. This might consist of, say, an $8 table fee plus
~$17 in beverages (e.g. 2-3 drinks per person). An experienced bar owner might set a target like $28
per head in the evening by upselling appetizers or premium drinks. Achieving 2+ drinks per
guest is key – industry data shows Saturday dinner-time parties often order ~2 rounds per tab on
average . In a poolroom bar, groups will often split hourly table rent, but each person buys drinks,
so boosting individual drink spend (through suggested sales, combos) lifts the average check.
Average Check – Late Night: After 10pm, average spend per patron ~$15-20 is expected. Latenight visitors tend to have shorter stays or may have “already been out,” spending a bit less overall.
They might just grab 1-2 drinks (often higher-ABV or a round of shots) before closing. In fact, while
drink prices are higher late at night (more call liquor orders) , the number of drinks per guest
typically dips – industry research shows rounds per party decline after 11pm as the hour grows late
. We assume roughly 1.5 drinks per late-night guest on average (e.g. one $9 cocktail or two $5
beers). The goal is to still entice a decent spend from these guests (perhaps via late-night specials
like a “midnight happy hour” or food offerings) to justify staying open. We will use ~$18/person as a
late-night average check for financial planning.
Staffing and Wages: Labor scheduling is split into day, evening, and late-night shifts to balance service
and cost. Our model assumes minimal daytime staff and heavier staffing on busy nights. A general
rule is one bartender per ~50-75 guests for good service . In Huntsville’s wage environment,
bartenders are tipped employees paid the Alabama base of $2.13/hr (tip credit), but effective
earnings ~$15/hr including tips . Barbacks/servers earn around $8-12/hr (often plus a tip-out
from bartenders). Security personnel command about $15/hr in this market – local ads list
$13-17/hr for bar security. We also budget for a on-duty manager or shift lead (could be the head
bartender) especially during peak times. Our target labor cost is 20-25% of sales for a bar-focused
venue , which is lower than a food-heavy restaurant (thanks to tips covering much of bartender
income). Hitting this ratio means efficiently adjusting staffing to match customer flow.
Security & Insurance Costs: Safe operations come with additional costs that must be budgeted. We
plan for at least one security staff (door person) on busy evenings, and two on weekend latenights, at ~$15/hour each. This typically adds ~$60-100 in labor expense per night, or $300-500 per
week for a small bar’s security – a worthwhile investment to prevent incidents. Insurance is a
significant fixed cost: Alabama requires liquor liability coverage (minimum $100k), which historically
was very expensive (premiums up to $30k/year under old dram shop laws) . Thankfully, a 2023
legal reform has lowered the risk rating. Now, basic liquor liability insurance for a bar might cost
on the order of $1,000 annually for a small venue , but can range higher depending on coverage
limits and prior claims. We assume a comprehensive policy (liability, property, liquor liability) in the
few-thousand dollars per year range. This includes general liability (often ~$500-1000/year for a bar)
 and possibly higher liquor liability coverage (many bars carry $1M policies which cost more). We

will mitigate insurance costs by maintaining a clean record and implementing the safety measures
noted below.
Late-Night Operations Considerations: Operating past conventional hours (e.g. 2am or even 24/7) is
only viable under certain conditions. In Alabama, alcohol service is cut off by 2am (bars must close by
this time in most jurisdictions). A true 24/7 model would require a private club license or special
exception, which is uncommon. Even if legally allowed, extreme late-night hours demand
sufficient sales to cover incremental staffing and security. For instance, keeping the bar open from
2am-4am would mean paying a skeleton crew (perhaps 1 bartender + 1 security + overhead), say
~$50-60 in labor per hour. To justify that, those hours should bring in at least 3-4× that in revenue
(e.g. $200/hour in sales) to maintain profitability. That might require a dedicated after-hours crowd
of ~20-30 patrons spending $7-10 each – unlikely in a mid-sized Southern city on most nights.
Outside of major 24-hour cities, operating through the night is generally not profitable . Thus, our
model assumes closing at 2am. If we ever consider extended hours (for example, a special event or a
private overnight league), we’d set minimum sales thresholds (e.g. only stay open if >20 paying
customers present) and use a lean staff. In short, late-night mode is only profitable if the average
check and headcount remain high enough to exceed the added costs (which include higher pay
for late-night shifts and potentially hazard pay for security). Otherwise, it’s more prudent to close,
cut losses, and preserve staff energy for the next day.
Hourly Staffing Schedule Template
Daytime / Opening (e.g. 12pm–5pm): During off-peak hours, keep staffing lean. Typically 1 bartender can
handle both bar service and floor (tables) since customer volume is low. No dedicated barback or security is
needed early; the bartender or manager on duty can check IDs at the bar. If the venue opens before
evening, it might even be the owner/manager tending bar to save labor. Example: Monday-Thursday
opening shift: 1 bartender (also acts as server), plus a cook if the kitchen is open. Total ~1-2 staff on duty.
This covers light lunch or afternoon business at minimal cost.
Evening Peak (5pm–10pm): As after-work and nighttime crowds arrive, ramp up staffing. 2 bartenders
behind the bar are recommended once patron count exceeds ~50. One bartender alone would be
overwhelmed if, say, 100 people are in the venue . Alongside the bartenders, schedule 1 barback (bar
assistant) during busy nights to restock beer, glassware, and help keep service fast. If table service is
offered for food or drinks, add a floor server or a third bartender who can float. Security: By evening, have
1 door/security person at the entrance (especially Thu-Sat) to check IDs, manage capacity, and act as a
bouncer if needed. This person can start around 7pm when the crowd builds. A dedicated manager or shift
lead should be on-site during peak – often the general manager or a lead bartender doubles in this role,
supervising operations, handling any escalations and monitoring cash. Example: On a busy Friday 8pm, staff
might be: 2 bartenders behind bar, 1 barback, 1 door security, 1 manager (who may also circulate on floor).
This team efficiently serves drinks, keeps an eye on customers, and maintains control.
Late Night (10pm–close): In the late-night period, maintain robust staffing to ensure service and safety
until closing. 2 bartenders remain on duty until last call (even if crowd thins, two are useful to handle
rushes like everyone ordering at 1:45am). The barback can begin cleanup duties after midnight but should
stay until close to assist with breakdown and restocking for the next day. Increase security to 2 guards for
closing time on high-traffic nights – one at the door (controlling entry, re-checking IDs of any late arrivals,
•

and preventing patrons from leaving with drinks) and one roaming inside to watch for altercations,
especially as patrons become more intoxicated. Around closing, security also encourages dispersal of
crowds and coordinates safe transport (e.g. calling cabs) for intoxicated guests. The manager on duty
should definitely stay through closing to oversee cash-out, ensure closing procedures (locks, alarms) are
followed, and to handle any incidents (late-night is when most liability issues occur). Example: Saturday
midnight-2am: 2 bartenders working at full speed (lots of shots and quick service drinks now), 1 barback
cleaning and running last-minute stock, 2 security guards on the floor (one monitoring the pool area and
one at front door), plus the manager collecting sales reports and keeping an eye on patron behavior. Once
2am hits, the team will lock up and do final cleanup; security walks out the last guests and watches over the
parking lot as people leave. Post-close (2am-3am) staff needed: 1-2 bartenders and the barback stay ~1
hour for cleanup/closing tasks (paid as part of their shift), and typically 1 security (or manager) stays until
everyone is out and safe.
Staff Scheduling Notes: The above template can be visualized as a staggered schedule. For instance, on a
Friday one bartender might start at 3pm (happy hour shift), second bartender starts at 7pm (to handle
crowd), both stay till close. Barback might work 8pm-2am only. Security comes in at 8pm (one guard), and
an extra guard joins at 10pm when it’s busiest. Always adjust staffing to day-of-week patterns (e.g. Monday
and Tuesday nights might need only 1 bartender and no security at all after 10pm if it’s consistently slow).
Aim to keep labor % in check by sending some staff home if an unexpected slow night occurs, and
conversely have on-call staff ready if a big crowd comes in. The template should be flexible, but never
compromise on having adequate coverage during late-night – it’s better to eat a slightly higher labor
cost on a slow night than to be understaffed when something goes wrong.
Bar + Venue Controls Checklist
✔ Strict ID Checks at Entry: Enforce a 100% ID check policy for all patrons to prevent underage entry.
Using an electronic ID scanner at the door is ideal – it verifies authenticity and keeps a log. This not only
keeps the venue compliant, it can also flag fake IDs and identify banned patrons. Checking IDs is a basic
requirement that all staff must follow (every bartender and server should ask for ID on alcohol orders too)
. Alabama’s laws are strict on serving minors, so this is non-negotiable. (Bonus: ID scanners and a visitor
log can help with contact tracing of incidents later, which insurance companies appreciate.)
✔ Surveillance Cameras (CCTV): Deploy a comprehensive camera system covering all key areas: entrances/
exits, the bar itself, gaming areas (pool tables), and any dark corners. Cameras serve as both deterrent and
evidence. Ensure footage is recorded and stored (e.g. 30+ days). This helps immensely with liability – if an
incident or claim occurs, you have video proof. It can also lower insurance premiums or be required by
insurers. Post signage that the premises are under surveillance (often required, and it further discourages
bad behavior).
✔ Alcohol Service Training for Staff: All bartenders and servers must be certified in responsible alcohol
service (programs like TIPS or ServSafe Alcohol). This training teaches staff how to spot intoxication, refuse
service tactfully, and handle difficult situations. Having “trained staff – yes” checked off is viewed favorably
by insurers and regulators . Regular in-house refreshers are good too: e.g. quarterly meetings to quiz
staff on ID protocols and pour sizes. Well-trained staff are the first line of defense against overserving and
dram shop liability.

✔ Pour Controls & Standard Recipes: Use standardized pour tools to prevent over-pouring. For instance,
regulated pour spouts on liquor bottles or jiggers for measuring shots (1.25 oz standard in Alabama ).
Consider locking optic dispensers or an automatic liquor dispensing system for high-volume nights. As
noted, systems like SkyFlo can drastically cut losses – even if you don’t invest in high-tech, at least use
measured pourers and track every open bottle. Maintain a recipe book for all house cocktails with exact
measurements; bartenders should stick to these portions so costs stay in line. Periodically do a pour test
(e.g. have staff pour a “shot” of water and then measure it) to recalibrate free-pour counts. Consistency
protects your margins.
✔ Inventory and Cash Controls: Implement nightly inventory counts for key items (e.g. count high-value
liquor bottles at close) and weekly full inventory. Use a POS that tracks drink sales by category and
compares to product usage. This will quickly highlight any discrepancies (shrinkage or theft). Require that
all sales go through the POS – no “cash jar” sales off the record. At end of night, the manager should
reconcile cash and credit slips, and log any comps or spills in a manager log book . This log is crucial for
tracking incidents (e.g. “broke up fight at 12:30am, one patron ejected”) and noting any wastage. A paper
trail of events and comps shows you’re monitoring operations diligently, which is useful if an insurance
claim or ABC inquiry arises.
✔ Patron Management & Security: Enforce a capacity limit and don’t overcrowd (for safety and legal
compliance). Security staff (or the manager) should periodically walk through the venue to monitor patron
behavior – especially around pool tables where disputes can occur over games. Any highly intoxicated
guests should be cut off and gently asked to switch to water or leave – document these interventions. It’s wise
to use a “buddy system” for handling intoxicated patrons – e.g. one staff member notifies a manager or
second staff before approaching, so they can back each other up if things go sideways. Have readily
available free water, coffee, and food (snacks) late at night to help slow down intoxication; this is a best
practice to reduce incidents. Develop a relationship with a local rideshare or taxi service and encourage (or
even incentivize) drunk patrons to take a safe ride home (some bars partner with Uber for discount codes).
These practices can reduce drunk-driving incidents tied to your bar, which in turn lowers liability.
✔ Incident Response Plan: Establish clear protocols for common incidents (fight, injury, etc.). For example,
if a fight breaks out: security separates individuals and removes them, manager decides if police need to be
called, incident is logged in detail, and any “problem customers” are barred entry next time. If someone
slips/falls or is hurt, staff should immediately render aid, call EMS if needed, and document what happened.
Having adequate lighting in all areas (including parking lot) is part of prevention – dark areas invite
accidents and crime. Ensure emergency exits are clearly marked and not obstructed. Conduct brief security
meetings with staff before each weekend shift to remind them of these procedures. A proactive safety
culture can favorably impact insurance; some insurers even give checklists of recommended measures (e.g.
removing tripping hazards, training staff in CPR, etc.). The bar should also maintain assault & battery
insurance coverage (often an add-on to liability policies) given the bouncer aspect – following these
practices may be required by that policy.
✔ No Excessive Drinks Specials that Encourage Bingeing: Avoid promotions that spike risk, such as
unlimited drinks or very cheap shots late at night. Deep discounts dramatically increase the chance of overintoxication and related incidents. In fact, many jurisdictions (and insurers) frown upon happy hour deals
after a certain time (e.g. after 10pm) . Our policy: no happy hour or special shots beyond 10 PM, and
no multi-shot drinking games. Instead, any late-night specials will be moderate (e.g. $1 off a beer, or a food
24
10
23

combo) rather than “$1 shots” or similar. This restraint shows we prioritize safety over a quick sale, and it
can help keep our liquor liability insurance premiums in check.
✔ Liability Insurance & Legal Compliance: Verify that all required licenses (liquor license, business
license, food service permit if applicable, etc.) are active and posted. Keep insurance policies current and
at adequate levels (liquor liability, general liability, property insurance). Use an ID scanner or manual log to
prove due diligence against underage service – this can be a lifesaver in court to show you took precautions.
Consider installing an age-verification system on vending (if a jukebox or vending machine dispenses
anything age-restricted). Engage with local law enforcement – for example, invite police to do a walkthrough on busy nights or hire off-duty officers as extra security, if needed. Visible cooperation with
authorities and strong preventative measures (ID checks, cameras, trained staff, documented policies)
significantly reduce the likelihood of liability incidents and can lower insurance hazard ratings for the venue
. Always remember: a well-managed, safety-conscious bar not only protects its patrons but also its
bottom line. Each item on this checklist helps create a safer environment and a more financially sustainable
operation.
