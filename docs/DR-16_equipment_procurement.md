## FINDINGS
Equipment Procurement Plan (DR-16) – Poolroom,
Huntsville AL
This plan identifies all major equipment needed for a 3,000–4,000 sq ft poolroom/bar (≈100+ occupancy),
with quantities, costs (mid/high), and vendor types. Each section summarizes key items, includes a sample
cost table, and notes sourcing or operational factors.
Billiards Equipment
The billiards area requires regulation tables and accessories. For ~3,500 sq ft we recommend roughly 8
tables (e.g. six 8-ft and two 9-ft) to support ~100 patrons (≈250–300 sq ft per table area ). Provide
~60–80 cues (8–10 per table plus extras) and enough cue racks to hold them (e.g. 4 wall racks of 15–20 cues
each). Overhead lighting (one fixture per table) is essential (Ram Gameroom LED lights are ~$300–500 each
). Each table needs a set of balls and a rack; plan one high-quality ball set per table plus 2–3 spares
(Aramith Premium sets ~$206 each ), and one triangle per table. Many halls use table covers at close-ofday; heavy-duty fitted covers run ~$70–$100 each (8ft model), vinyl covers ~$10–$20 .

weeks ). Preferred vendors: order tables direct from manufacturers (e.g. Diamond Billiards, Brunswick)
via local dealers; accessories (balls, racks) from billiards suppliers (ImperialUSA, Web retailers).

Bar Equipment
A full bar requires refrigeration, draft dispensing, sinks, and barware:
Back-bar refrigerators: e.g. a 70″ solid-door cooler (~$3,000 mid, $5,000 high) for beer/mixers.
Vendors: True, Beverage-Air (wholesale sources like Webstaurant ).
Draft beer system: If serving draft, install a 2–4-tap kegerator or Glycol draft system (~$1,000–2,000
for a 2-tap kegerator; $3,000+ for a multi-tap refrigerated tower). Preferred: beverage equipment
supplier (e.g. Kegco, local beer-equipment vendors).
Underbar sinks: Commercial 3-compartment sinks are required. A 3-bowl underbar sink is ~$600–
$700 mid-range (e.g. Regency 72″ 3-bowl ~$949 ), while a full 4-bowl runs ~$989 . Include
drainboards and faucets. Source: restaurant suppliers (Webstaurant, ACityDiscount).
Ice machine: A 150–200 lb/day ice maker for bar use (~$2,500 mid, $4,000 high). Vendors: Hoshizaki,
Scotsman via foodservice suppliers.
Barware and tools: Glassware (e.g. pint, rocks, wine glasses – stock 100–200 of common types, ~$1–
3 each), speed rails ($30–$100 each), and cocktail tools (sets ~$200). Many bars buy these in bulk
from US restaurant distributors or Amazon.

Notes: Order heavy equipment (refrigerators, ice machine) early (lead times 4–8 weeks). Underbar sinks
often require custom fit; partner with local plumbing supply. Consider liquor-control systems (e.g. SkyFlo) to
reduce waste: these programmable pour spouts can cut liquor over-pours by ~20–30% .
Kitchen Equipment (if applicable)
If the concept includes food (snacks/pizza), plan a minimal “kitchen-lite” area:
- Cooking appliances: e.g. electric pizza oven or countertop convection oven ($2,000–$3,000), one fryer for
fries/chicken ($1,500). If minor food, a toaster oven + microwave may suffice.
- Prep tables: Stainless steel work tables (4–6′) – $400 each (mid-range) up to $1,000 (heavy-duty with
shelves).
- Refrigeration: Possibly a small walk-in cooler for kegs/beverages ($5,000+), or under-counter fridge
($1,500) for prepped food. A 2-door reach-in fridge (~$2,500).
- Storage shelving: NSF wire shelving units ($100–$200 each) for dry storage.
These items are typically purchased from restaurant/kitchen suppliers (Webstaurant, ACityDiscount) or
dealers. Lead time for major appliances is usually a few weeks; get bids and order after design freeze.
POS & Payment Systems
A modern POS ensures fast service: plan for 2–3 terminals (one at bar, one or two roaming or counter) plus
network. Each terminal package (touchscreen + stand + reader + printer + cash drawer) costs roughly $800–
$1,200 . For example, Toast and Square bundles run ~$1,000 per station (tablet, printer, card reader) .
Additional receipt or kitchen printers are ~$300 each. Accepting cards requires EMV readers ($50–$100
each). Consider one or two large displays (or TVs) for kitchen/bar tickets ($500–$800 each).
Item Qty Approx. Price Vendor/Notes
POS terminal bundle 2 $1,000 each Toast, Square (includes case, stand, reader, printer)
Receipt/printer 2 $300 each Thermal receipt printers
Credit card reader 2 $50–$100 each EMV-enabled (Square/Toast)
Kitchen/bar display 1–2 $500 each 20–27″ monitor (KDS)
Router/Wi-Fi 1 $200 (for cloud-based POS)
Notes: POS hardware is relatively quick to procure, but ensure installation near network/phones. Plan for 4–
6 weeks lead time for any custom integrations or branded systems.
AV & Lighting
To set atmosphere and for sports, install a sound and video system:
- Sound: A small PA system (4–6 ceiling or wall speakers + amplifier/mixer) is ~$2,000 mid (Yamaha/JBL entry
systems) and up to ~$5,000 for higher-end setups. Local AV integrators or pro audio suppliers can design
this.
- TVs/Projector: Plan 2–4 TVs (55″–75″) – ~$500–$1,000 each. Or one HD projector with screen ($1,500–
16
17 17
17
3
$3,000). Sports bars often use multiple TVs.
- General lighting: In addition to pool lights, install ambient and bar lighting (recessed or track LEDs).
Budget ~50–100 LED downlights ($20–$50 each) and some decorative fixtures.
- Sound proofing/acoustics: If heavy crowd, consider acoustic panels ($100 each).
Item Qty Price Range Notes
Speakers (80W) 6 $100 each JBL/Peavey in-ceiling speakers
Amplifier/Mixer 1 $500–$1,000 Commercial amplifier/mixer
TVs (55″) 3 $600 each Samsung/LG 4K TVs
Projector+screen 1 $2,000 (alternative to TVs)
Ambient lighting – see below LED fixtures throughout
Notes: AV equipment is widely available. Schedule speaker/TV installation after electrical rough-in.
Survivability: use tamper-proof mounts. For televisions, use commercial-grade models if budget allows.
Security & Access Control
For patron and staff safety, include: - ID scanner/verification: A digital ID scanner (~$300–$500) at entry
(ensures age) or an app-based check (e.g. BarZ). - Surveillance (CCTV): At least 4–8 cameras (2 at bar, 2 on
pool area, 2 outside) and an NVR/DVR. IP cameras run ~$100–$200 each; a basic 8-channel NVR ~$400–
$600. Ensure 30–45 day video retention (≈2–3 TB) as recommended (e.g. 30 days for common areas ). -
Panic/duress buttons: A couple of wall-mounted panic buttons near bar/register ($50–$100 each) that
silently alert staff or call police. - Door control: Electric strike or maglock on back door (~$200) plus keypad
or keyfob entry system ($150+). - Alarm system: Standard burglar/fire alarm (vendor quotes vary).
Item Qty Approx. Price Vendor/Notes
ID card scanner 1 $300 (e.g. Scannet)
IP Security camera 6 $150 each e.g. Hikvision/Dahua via security supplier
NVR (8-ch) 1 $500 (store video 1-2 months)
Panic button 2 $75 each (wired alert device)
Access control lock 1 $200 Electric strike with keypad
Notes: Cameras should cover entry/bar and open areas. Install with proper signage. Retention: comply with
privacy laws; as a guide UAH policy retains 30–45 days . Preferred vendors: local security integrator for
installation, or online (Lorex, Verkada, etc.) for equipment.
Furniture & General Fixtures
Finally, seating, waste, and decor:
- Tables/Chairs: Estimate ~10–15 four-top tables (for spectators/dining) plus ~40–60 chairs, and ~10
18
18
4
barstools. Budget $100–$200 per table, $40–$60 per chair, $100 per barstool. Consider durable, wipe-clean
restaurant furniture.
- Trash/recycling bins: Place ~10–15 bins ($20–$50 each) indoors and outdoors.
- Coat hooks/racks: Wall-mounted coat racks (10–20 ft lineal) or 100+ individual hooks ($5 each).
- Signage: Exterior sign (local sign shop, $1,000–$5,000 depending on size/lighting) plus internal menus/
wayfinding (DIY or print shop, ~$200–$500).
Item Qty Price (each) Vendor/Notes
4-top tables 12 $150 Restaurant furniture suppliers
Chairs 50 $50 (sturdy, e.g. metal/plastic)
Bar stools 12 $100 (with backs recommended)
Trash bins (30gal) 10 $30 Commercial bins
Coat hook (double) 50 $5 (wall-mounted)
Exterior signage – $3,000 (custom illuminated sign)
Notes: Bulk-purchase furniture/fixtures to save costs; wholesalers like Restaurant Furniture or even local
retailers. Order after final layout approved.
Procurement Timeline & Sequence
Design freeze: Finalize layouts and equipment list at least 4–5 months before opening. Early design
coordination with architect/contractor is critical to set equipment dimensions.
Long-lead orders (3–4 months out): Pool tables (8–12 week lead ), custom bar/draft system,
large refrigeration (2–6 week), ice machine. Place these orders immediately after design freeze to
align with construction.
Mid-lead orders (2–3 months out): Underbar sinks, kitchen appliances, POS hardware (often 2–4
week lead), AV system components, security hardware.
Near-install orders (1 month out): Furniture (tables/chairs), smallwares (glassware, tools), signage,
waste bins, décor. These can arrive late without blocking construction.
Delivery & installation: Stagger deliveries so that equipment is installed after rough-in work. For
example, bar cooler and sinks should arrive when plumbing is ready; sound system installed after
ceiling lighting is in; pool tables assembled last once flooring is finished. Professional installers
(especially for pool tables – they are heavy and need leveling) should be booked in advance.
Example timeline milestones:
1. T-16 weeks: Finalize design; issue orders for tables, large coolers, kitchen hood, ice machine.
2. T-12 weeks: Confirm arrival dates; order bar equipment (kegerator, sinks), POS, AV.
3. T-8 weeks: Begin receiving heavy equipment; install refrigeration, sinks, hood, electrical panels.
4. T-4 weeks: Receive furniture, decorate, install lights and sound. Finalize POS/network.
5. T-1 week: Delivery and assembly of pool tables, bar stools, last fixtures. System testing and staff training.
Lead time reference: Many billiard tables and special items run 2–3 months ; refrigerated equipment often
4–6 weeks. Always confirm current lead times with suppliers.

Warranties, Service & Operations
Warranties: Most equipment comes with 1-year parts/ labor warranties. Extend warranties on highuse items (refrigeration, ice machine, POS) when possible (2–5 years). For example, glasswashers
often have 1-year; consider service contracts via the brand (Noble/Champion) or third-party.
Maintenance: Arrange periodic maintenance for critical gear (beer lines flushed monthly, HVAC
filters changed, lighting checked). Pool tables should be re-leveled and cloth brushed regularly;
consider a ball retriever or slide cover for cloth (if not covered nightly).
Operational controls: Install a liquor control system (e.g. SkyFlo, Ikeg) to enforce fixed pours –
proven to cut waste up to ~30% . Consider a POS inventory module to track drinks. For beer, keg
alarms or monitors can avoid spoilage.
CCTV recordings: Keep at least 30 days of footage for general areas and 45 days for cash registers
. Ensure a policy for use/storage and train managers on retrieval.
Software subscriptions: Budget for POS monthly fees ($60–$200/month ) and any license
renewals (sound/light control, security monitoring, etc.).
Spare parts: Stock critical spares (light bulbs, printer rolls, outlet fuses) on opening day to avoid
downtime.
Each section above blends mid-range cost estimates with high-end options. Vendors should be reputable
brands or distributors: e.g. Diamond Billiards/Brunswick for tables, WebstaurantStore/RestaurantSupply for
kitchen/bar appliances, Toast/Square for POS, Noble/Champion for warewashing, and local H-T-E contractors
for installation. Balancing cost and durability is key: choose commercial-grade gear where reliability affects
operations, and use competitively priced options where feasible. All items and quantities should be
reviewed against final layout and fire-code requirements before ordering.
Sources: Authoritative industry catalogs and retailers were used for pricing and specs (e.g. Monarch
Billiards , Imperial USA , WebstaurantStore ). POS and retention guidelines from published
resources inform recommendations. Each item’s cost and vendor is indicative of the U.S. South
market.
