## FINDINGS
Poolroom Launch Marketing Plan
Brand Positioning & Differentiators: Poolroom will position itself as a modern, fun “poolhall + bar” hybrid
that appeals to Millennials and college‐age patrons seeking a social, well‐lit venue. Unlike Huntsville’s
existing halls, Poolroom emphasizes a premium-but-casual vibe: high-quality Diamond tables, attractive
lighting and décor, curated drink/menu offerings, and no indoor smoking. By contrast, competitors have very
different images: for example, Bumpers Billiards bills itself as “North Alabama’s upscale pool-playing
destination,” but it permits indoor smoking (a frequent customer complaint ). Steve’s Cue & Grill is a
neighborhood dive‐bar vibe – cheap tables and food, full of longtime league players and smoking indoors
 – while Chips & Salsa is a loud hybrid sports bar with dozens of tables (with a separate non-smoking
room) and a heavy focus on tacos and sports . Poolroom’s key differentiators will be clean, smoke-free
environment; stylish, Instagrammable décor (neon and retro signage); flexible play options; and
community events. We will position Poolroom as more upscale and social than a dive hall (targeting “neon
lounge” rather than dive-bar), but also more relaxed and approachable than a nightclub – e.g. “laid-back
casino‐fun for adults.” (For context, Huntsville has ~492K people and an estimated 40–50K local adults
interested in billiards .) Key positioning bullets:
Modern, inclusive atmosphere: A polished, club-like interior with neon accents, digital music
playlists or DJs, and comfortable seating. We’ll highlight “pool meets party” and quality cocktails.
(Image below: a clean, neon-lit pool table environment.)
Figure: Example of Poolroom’s high-end pool-table ambiance.
No-smoking policy: Unlike local halls, Poolroom will strictly enforce 21+ and no-smoking (fans of
Bumpers and Steve’s often complain of haze ). This will attract non-smokers and female
patrons. We’ll prominently note “21+ only” signage and train staff on strict ID checks to avoid
any minor loitering violations .

Flexible pricing & play: Instead of expensive table rentals, Poolroom will market daily specials and
memberships. (By contrast, Iron City Billiards in Birmingham heavily promotes a flat unlimited rate –
e.g. “$5/day unlimited play” on 7ft tables – illustrating that cheap flat fees can draw big
crowds. Poolroom might use similar targeted specials, but combine them with loyalty tiers and event
packages for a more upscale feel.)
Entertainment & Amenities: In addition to pool, we’ll offer dart boards, shuffleboard or video
games as described below. We’ll emphasize keeping guests entertained (see Toast POS: “games like
pool and darts… encourage guests to bring larger groups… leading to increased food and drink
sales” ).
Launch Timeline (90 days): Marketing will roll out in three phases:
Pre-Launch (Weeks –12 to –1): Finalize branding (logo, website, social pages). Implement a “coming
soon” campaign: launch a simple landing page for email sign-ups and social follow. Distribute a
press kit and teaser press release ~2 months before opening (e.g. “Poolroom coming soon to
Huntsville”) to local media (AL.com, Hville Blast, Huntsville Business Journal, local TV), timed to key
milestones . (KC Projects did this for a new Huntsville bar, securing early coverage in AL.com,
WAFF-48 and lifestyle blogs via phased PR .) Schedule soft-open “friends & family” and influencer
preview nights 2–3 weeks out (invite local bar bloggers, food influencers, sports personalities for
exclusive first looks). Create campus buzz via a student ambassador program: recruit UAH/A&M
ambassadors to put up posters, distribute flyers at orientation, and tease with a “student discount”
offer. Initiate targeted social ads (FB/Instagram) aimed at Millennials/college-age 21–30 in
Huntsville . Begin posting behind-the-scenes build-out and pre-opening countdown on social
channels.
Launch Week (Days 0–7): Host a multi-day grand opening party. Day 1 might be a VIP/media night;
Days 2–3 open to public with specials. Partner with local radio/TV for live segments – e.g. arrange onsite WAFF-48 broadcast and studio interview . Use this media opportunity to highlight Poolroom’s
differentiators. Plan themed nights each evening (e.g. “Retro Night”, “Ladies’ Night”, “Pool Tourney
Open”) with drink specials and photo ops. Activate influencer marketing: invite lifestyle/influencer
attendees (wristbands, free swag, cocktails) to post stories. Distribute press releases and pitch local
outlets with human-interest angles (e.g. “New Huntsville billiards hall adds nightclub vibe”). The goal
is a “citywide moment,” similar to One Eleven’s launch that generated TV segments and $79K in
earned-media value .
Post-Launch (Days 8–90): Sustain momentum. Continue weekly events (e.g. pool tournaments, trivia
nights, live music on weekends). Implement loyalty program/email newsletter for repeat visits. In
weeks 2–4, reengage press/outlets with follow-ups (e.g. coverage of first tournaments). Increase paid
social ads boosted by opening-week content. Roll out loyalty tiers (e.g. “Rack Club” membership with
perks). Organize grassroots nights – e.g. UAH student nights on Mondays, APA league partnership
nights (host league play on Tuesdays, sponsor local league tournaments). At 30/60/90 days, measure
foot traffic vs. goals and adjust (for example, adding a college deal if student turnout lags). Maintain
social hype by sharing user-generated photos and reviews. (KC Projects found continued media
pitches and storytelling around the concept kept One Eleven in the news well after opening .)

Channel Mix & Marketing Tactics
Digital Advertising:
Social Media (Facebook/Instagram/TikTok): Run geo-targeted ads (e.g. women 21–30, men 21–35,
within 15-mile radius) promoting events and offers . Schedule ads for slower nights (Mon–Tue) to
promote special deals (e.g. “Free Pool Mondays!”) . Use saved offer codes or ask guests to
mention a promo code to measure ad conversion . Post daily content (drink specials, behind-thescenes build, staff intros) to engage followers. Track followers and engagement as KPIs (e.g. aim
+500 followers/month).
Email Marketing: Drive landing-page sign-ups with a grand-opening giveaway (e.g. “Win free pool for
a month”). Send weekly newsletters with news/events. Use automated email/SMS reminders for
booked events or birthdays. (Toast POS notes that collecting emails and texting targeted promotions
boosts repeat visits .)
Website/SEO: Launch a simple, mobile-optimized site with hours, menu, events calendar and booking
info . Ensure Poolroom appears on Google Maps, Yelp, and local directories. (Toast suggests an
online presence so people “find you when searching for bars” .)
Local Media & PR:
Issue press releases at key milestones: lease signed, build-out complete, opening date announced,
etc. Pitch local press (AL.com, Huntsville Times, 256 Today, Yellowhammer News, lifestyle blogs like
Soul Grown) as in One Eleven’s campaign .
Secure interviews/features with local TV (WAFF-48, WHNT 19) and radio morning shows (WMMS,
102.1 FM alternative rock, local sports talk) to reach target demographics. Aim for at least 5–10
media placements in the first month (One Eleven achieved 12 placements and 2 TV segments ).
Engage PR firms/partners if budget allows. If in-house, designate a spokesperson for media. Invite
press to cover opening and major events.
Influencers & Partnerships:
Collaborate with local social media influencers and student leaders (e.g. @SoulGrown,
@AlabamaAstro pics, bar bloggers). Offer them “VIP night” invites or gift bags of branded merch (Tshirts, cues, bottle openers). Encourage them to share their experience. (“Partnering with influencers
can expand your reach and create buzz” .)
Cross-promote with complementary businesses: local breweries, coffee shops, restaurants and retail.
For example, arrange a “pint and pool” night with a brewery where customers get a free pool game
with beer purchase. Do pop-up events with other venues (e.g. a local taco shop doing “Taco Tuesday”
at Poolroom) .
Event Marketing:
Host ongoing theme nights and leagues: e.g. trivia or karaoke nights, speed-pool tournaments,
seasonal parties (Super Bowl, Halloween). Promote these via FB Events and posters. As Toast advises,
themed events “create excitement and draw crowds” .

Weekday promotions: e.g. free pool Mondays (as many halls do ), BOGO drinks Tuesdays
(targeting students), Ladies’ Night.
Offer member-only events (pool league season kick-off, billiards clinics) to build community.
Create branded collateral: event flyers and social media graphics. (For example, a neon-inspired
“Grand Opening” flyer design emphasizing Poolroom’s logo/theme colors.)
Signage & Street Presence:
Install clear, eye-catching exterior signage (neon or backlit logo) so passersby immediately notice
Poolroom at night【65†】. Illuminate the façade and windows.
Use sidewalk A-frame signs, banners, or balloon arches during opening week. Even neon “OPEN”
signs or LED message boards can draw late-night traffic【65†】.
Decorate windows with door decals/promos (“$5 off your next game”, “21+ only”).
Place flyers and posters at nearby high-traffic locations: college student union boards, apartment
complexes, other bars (with permission).
Grassroots & Community Tactics:
University Targeting: Sponsor a student mixer or alumni event at campus (e.g. homecoming
tailgate presence). Host an official “college night” every Thursday (e.g. discounted entrance with
student ID). Recruit UAH/A&M alumni group ambassadors to spread the word. (A guerrilla campus
marketing campaign – chalk art on sidewalks, handing out branded koozies, etc – can make
Poolroom “the place” for college kids.)
League Partnerships: Partner with the APA (American Poolplayers Association) and local league
organizers. Become an official venue for weekly APA tournaments, offering reduced or free table
time to league members. Display APA logos and offer league registration discounts. (Clubs often
grow loyal patronage via league play.)
Bar Cross-Promotions: Work with other bars/breweries to offer reciprocal discounts (“Show any bar
receipt for 10% off”). Co-sponsor charity night events or bar crawls.
Specials and Game Promotions: Feature weekly specials on games (free pool on slow nights, as in
Napper Tandy’s ). Offer happy hour drink specials during early evenings. Possibly use electronic
punchcards or app check-ins.
Compliance & Risk Management
Age & Licensing: By law, Poolroom is 21+ at all times . We must prominently post “No one under
21 allowed” signs at the entrance and train staff to card every patron. Per Alabama pool hall law,
allowing minors to “play or loiter” is a violation . Staff (bartenders, door staff) will undergo ageverification and responsible-service training. All marketing materials will note “21+” and avoid
implying a family venue.
Hours of Service: Alabama prohibits alcohol sales after 2:00 AM . Poolroom will advertise its lastcall time (e.g. “Last rack at 1:45 AM”) and routinely close by 2 AM. We will coordinate closely with local
ABC rules (Huntsville zoning allows midnight-2 AM by special permit) so as not to operate
“underground” bar hours.

Dram Shop & Liability: We will carry robust liquor liability insurance. Recognizing Alabama’s dram
shop law, staff will be trained to refuse over-intoxicated patrons . We’ll post taxi/Uber info to
encourage safe rides . All incidents (ejections, overservice refusals) will be logged as best practice.
Marketing Ethics: All promotions will comply with alcohol advertising guidelines (no “free liquor”
giveaways). Marketing will never encourage drinking games or bingeing. Nighttime events will
emphasize responsible enjoyment (e.g. free water, food availability).
KPIs & Metrics
To measure launch success, Poolroom will track:
First-Week Foot Traffic: Aim for X patrons in opening week (benchmark by comparing to local venue
openings); track daily entries via POS or guest count.
Email Sign-Ups & Followers: Target ~1,000 email subscribers and 3,000 social followers by Day 90.
(KPI: # of new emails per month, follower growth rate.)
Table Utilization: Monitor “table-hours” sold per day. (Goal: e.g. 75% of table capacity filled on Fri/
Sat night by month-end.)
Instagram Engagement: Number of posts tagged @Poolroom, user-generated content. (We’ll
encourage check-ins with a hashtag contest.)
Cost per New Customer (CAC): E.g. Facebook ad spend divided by number of first-time customers
attributed to that ad. Aim for a sustainable CAC (e.g. <$20) given an average check ~$25 .
Promotion Redemption: Track usage of promo codes (e.g. student ID offers, free-drink coupons).
Revenue Growth: Compare weekly sales ramp-up against forecast. (For context, industry data
suggests small bars spend ~7–8% of revenue on marketing ; we’ll adjust spend if ROI lags.)
Media/PR Impressions: Count placements and estimated reach (One Eleven reported ~$79K PR
value for their launch ).
Wherever possible, tactics will include tracking. For instance, the Toast POS guide advises requiring guests
to save a social offer or mention a promo code – this lets us directly link visits to ads .
Costs & ROI
A prudent budget will be set at roughly 5–8% of projected revenue (industry surveys show marketing
budgets of ~7–8% for competitive categories ). In practical terms, for an estimated first-year revenue of \
$500K, that’s \$25K–\$40K for marketing. Initial spends might include: a professional website (\$1–2K),
signage/graphic design (\$2–3K), digital ad budget (\$500–\$1,000/month), grand-opening event (staffing,
supplies ~\$5K), and influencer/PR outreach (samples, media kits ~$2K). We expect early ROI mainly via
new-customer visits: for example, \$5K on targeted social ads could generate 5,000 impressions with ~50
new customers (if CPA \$100 each by sign-up), translating to \$2.5K initial sales – then word-of-mouth
grows. Over 90 days, if the venue welcomes ~5,000 unique customers at \$25 average spend, that’s \$125K
revenue. Even a modest 15% increase in sales due to the launch campaign (vs. organic growth) would cover
the budget. Continuous tracking will allow course-correction: for instance, if a Facebook campaign costs \
$1/CPM and yields a 2% click-through, we’ll calculate precise CAC (cost per paying guest) and adjust bids. (As
a benchmark, bars often see a 2–5× return on well-targeted social ad campaigns.) In all, we anticipate
breakeven on marketing spend within 3–4 months post-launch, after which positive ROI accrues from
repeat business and sustained foot traffic.

Inspiration from Similar Concepts
Poolroom’s strategy draws on the successes of barcade/gaming venues and entertainment bars in midsized markets. For example, concepts like Barcade or Punch Bowl Social built hype by blending nostalgic
arcade games with craft drinks and themed events. A Toast POS case study notes that providing social
games keeps patrons longer and drives higher check averages , and examples like Napper Tandy’s show
free-game nights boosting weekday traffic . In practice, we will incorporate modern “social bar”
elements (neon signs, curated playlists) that have worked for Southern entertainment lounges – while
tailoring them for Huntsville’s culture. The PR approach follows the model of KC Projects’ launch of One
Eleven in downtown Huntsville: targeted media coverage and staged events turned a new bar into a “mustvisit” within weeks . By mixing those proven tactics with our unique billiards twist, Poolroom aims to
become Huntsville’s go-to late-night social hub.
