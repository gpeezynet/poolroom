Huntsville Pool Hall Market Analysis (15–25 Minute
Radius)
TAM/SAM – Market Demand for Pool-Interested Adults
Population & Interest: The Huntsville metro area has ~492,000 people (around 250k in the city
proper). Nationally, about 33 million Americans play pool (roughly 10% of the population). Applying
this ratio locally suggests on the order of 40–50k adults in the Huntsville area with some interest in
billiards. However, the core enthusiast segment is smaller – likely a few thousand who play
regularly (leagues, frequent bar players).
League Participation: Huntsville has a strong presence of amateur leagues. The APA (American
Poolplayers Association) North Alabama division hosts multiple 8-ball and 9-ball teams in the area
(anecdotally 40+ teams, i.e. ~320+ players). League matches are held at various bars (e.g. Bumpers,
Chips & Salsa, Diamonds) on weeknights. This indicates an existing Serviceable Available Market
(SAM) of a few hundred competitive players, and a larger pool of casual players who could be drawn
into a new venue.
Nightlife & Bar Density: Huntsville’s nightlife is modest but growing. TripAdvisor lists 15+ notable
bars/clubs in the city, and there’s an emerging brewery scene. Nightlife is somewhat clustered –
e.g. the downtown Courthouse Square area (Voodoo Lounge, Martin Bar), and the Campus No. 805
district (a repurposed school housing breweries, bars, an arcade) is a popular entertainment hub.
Still, locals often comment that Huntsville “lacks” in nightlife options compared to bigger cities,
suggesting room for new venues. Many bars here are laid-back pubs or brewery taprooms rather
than dance clubs – a culture that aligns well with pool halls.
Existing Bars & Pool Halls: Within a ~25-minute drive, there are only a handful of dedicated pool
halls, plus several bars with a few tables. A Yelp search highlights about 6–8 billiards-focused
venues in the Huntsville/Madison area. The major ones (detailed below) include large pool halls
(with 8–30 tables) and some smaller neighborhood bars. This relatively low venue count (for a metro
approaching half a million people) points to a moderate TAM: many potential players but few
dedicated outlets.
In summary, tens of thousands of adults in the area enjoy pool at least occasionally, and several thousand
could be expected to frequent a well-positioned new pool bar. Proxy signals like league activity and the
current bar landscape confirm steady demand but also an opportunity to capture unmet interest.
Competitor Matrix (Within ~25 Minutes of Huntsville)
Below is a breakdown of key competitors in the local market, including their offerings and positioning:
•

Bumpers Billiards (Huntsville)
Tables: 24 tables total (16 seven-foot bar boxes and 8 nine-foot tables – all Diamond brand). Highquality equipment and ample capacity.
Pricing: Flat rate: $8 per person for unlimited play (wristband, play all night) . This is a daily rate;
they often run free-play specials (e.g. free pool for military/first responders on Sundays) .
Hours: Open Mon–Fri 3:00pm–2:00am; Sat–Sun 12:00pm–2:00am. Happy Hour from 3–7pm
weekdays.
League Nights: An official host location for the APA league – Bumpers promotes APA team sign-ups
and hosts regional APA tournaments. League play and in-house weekly tournaments (8-ball
tournament every Friday night) keep certain weeknights busy .
Food & Bar: Full bar with a huge selection of liquor and beer. The kitchen offers a bar-grill menu
(burgers, wings, etc.) and is open evenings (5:30pm–12:30am). Alcohol selection is a draw, while food
is standard bar fare.
Vibe: Markets itself as “North Alabama’s upscale pool-playing destination”. The hall is spacious and
well-lit, attracting both serious players and casual groups. Smoking is permitted indoors, which
some patrons appreciate and others cite as a negative (reviews note the room can get smoky).
Overall atmosphere is friendly and social, with a mix of league regulars and college/twenties crowd.
Google Rating: ~4.0 out of 5. Patrons praise the table quality and service, but smoke odor is a
common complaint.
Busiest Times: Weekends and any tournament nights. Even Monday league nights can be quite
busy. Friday tournaments and weekend evenings often see most tables in use. (Sunday nights are
steady due to the free pool special.)
Notable Features: Houses a pro shop for cues and billiards gear on-site – distinguishing it as a hub
for serious players. Owned by a pro player, Bumpers also hosts notable events (it was a site for the
U.S. Amateur preliminaries), further solidifying its reputation among enthusiasts.
Steve’s Cue & Grill (Huntsville)
Tables: 14 tables (recently upgraded to all Diamond tables). Specifically, 13 seven-footers and 1
eight-foot “challenge table.” No full-size 9ft tables. Equipment condition is well-maintained postupgrade.
Pricing: Hourly: $7.00 per hour (or $3.50 per half-hour) per table. They also offer an all-day
wristband for $10, which is unique and encourages longer play. This pricing is very affordable,
undercutting many competitors. Tables are rented by the hour (not per person).
Hours: Open 7 days a week. Monday–Saturday typically 11:00am–2:00am, and Sunday afternoons to
12am (exact hours can vary; for instance currently listed as closing at midnight). The long hours and
midday opening make it accessible for daytime play.
League Nights: Steve’s has been an APA league site in the past (teams have played out of Steve’s),
though Bumpers/Chips carry more APA action. It’s known more for informal weekly tournaments
and local “money games.” There is a strong contingent of regulars/old-timers who treat Steve’s as
their home room.
Food & Bar: Beer and liquor bar with a “simple grill” kitchen. The menu features classic bar food –
burgers, fries, sandwiches – at very low prices (daily specials ~$5–7). Food is decent but the draw is
more the pool and relaxed atmosphere.
Vibe: A true neighborhood pool hall. It has a no-frills, old-school vibe – “dive bar” in the best sense.
The staff are known to be friendly and the service personal. Smoking is allowed inside (they even
sell cigarettes at the counter) , so it can get hazy. Expect a mixed crowd: league shooters, blue-

collar regulars, and college students from nearby UAH. It’s less “upscale” than Bumpers, but many
appreciate the laid-back, nostalgic feel.
Google/Yelp Rating: ~4.5★. Reviewers often mention the welcoming atmosphere and recent
equipment improvements (the Diamond tables are a big plus). Some minor complaints about smoke
or it being “hidden” in an older strip center, but overall seen as a local gem.
Busiest Times: Evenings and weekends. Weeknights see league or tournament action occasionally,
but generally you can get a table. Friday and Saturday nights bring out a crowd (and the place only
has 14 tables, so waits can happen at peak times). Daytime play is light, except maybe some retirees
or off-shift regulars.
Notable: Steve’s has a long history (in operation for decades, moved to current location around
1980) and is locally famous. It’s one of the few places with an in-house cue repair/sales (small proshop corner). Known for its challenge table tradition on the 8-foot – winner stays on, attracting
decent players.
Chips & Salsa Sports Bar & Grill (Huntsville)
Tables: Approximately 25–30 pool tables – making it one of the largest pool venues in North
Alabama. Tables are 7-foot bar boxes. There’s also a separate non-smoking room with additional
tables (part of the total count) to accommodate those who avoid smoke. Availability is usually good
due to the sheer number of tables.
Pricing: Per person: Approximately $5 cover for unlimited pool (all night) is reported on most days,
which is a bargain. They frequently run free pool nights too – e.g. Sunday free pool (with
conditions). Essentially, Chips uses a low flat fee model (cover charge) rather than hourly rental. This
encourages large groups to come play cheaply.
Hours: Open 7 days, 11:00am–2:00am (kitchen closes around midnight). It functions as a lunch
restaurant as well, given the full menu, and transitions to more of a bar atmosphere at night.
League Nights: Hosts APA league play – notably, Monday night APA divisions often rotate here.
Chips is a favored APA venue because of the table quantity (they can accommodate many teams at
once). They also hold in-house tournaments and have pool league trophies on display, indicating a
strong league following.
Food & Bar: A full-service restaurant + bar. Uniquely, it serves a Mexican-American menu (tacos,
burritos, wings, burgers, etc.), and the food quality gets good reviews – “never had a bad meal
there” as one regular states. Daily specials like half-off ladies’ meals on Sunday draw a crowd. The
bar offers standard beers and cocktails; prices are moderate (domestic beers ~$3, imports/craft ~$4–
5, cocktails around $6–7).
Vibe: Very much a hybrid of sports bar and pool hall. It’s lively, often loud – they have a DJ or
jukebox music on the main side, TVs with sports on, etc. Smoking is allowed in the main bar area,
but they crucially have a non-smoking lounge side for pool players who prefer a smoke-free
environment. This dual setup is a selling point. The crowd is diverse: you’ll see serious pool
enthusiasts alongside casual bar-goers, and a notable presence of female players especially on
“Ladies’ Night” (it’s a more inclusive atmosphere than some dive bars). The overall vibe is upbeat and
social – a place to “shoot pool, drink, and hang out” rather than a quiet pool room.
Google Rating: ~4.3★. Many reviewers highlight the abundance of tables and fun environment, as
well as the good food. Occasional negatives mention the smoke on the bar side or crowdedness
during big events.
Busiest Times: Weekend nights are very busy – almost all tables in use, especially with larger
groups. Weeknight leagues (Mon/Tue) bring in players but due to the table count, open tables
usually remain. Sunday is surprisingly popular because of promotions (free pool for certain groups,

etc.). Overall, Chips’ size allows it to handle peak crowds; you “will find plenty of elbow room to swing
a cue” even on busier nights.
Notable: It breaks the mold by being a full restaurant + pool hall, and by catering to non-smokers
with a separate area. They host unique events like music bingo, karaoke, and ladies’ night
specials to attract people who might not come just for pool. This multi-faceted approach (dining,
entertainment, billiards) makes it a one-stop nightlife spot on Huntsville’s south side.
Diamonds Sports Bar (Huntsville)
Tables: Around 6–8 pool tables available. (Not explicitly advertised, but multiple reviews mention a
good selection of tables, so likely in that range.) Tables are bar-size; at least some are kept leveled
and in good shape. They also have darts. Capacity is more limited than the big halls, making it a
smaller pool venue.
Pricing: Hybrid model: $6/hour per table (rented from the bar) or coin-op play by the game. In
practice, many casual players opt to drop quarters in (about \$0.75 per game). For longer sessions,
renting by the hour is economical. There’s no per-person charge and no cover on normal nights.
Notably, on live music nights they might charge a small door cover (~$2) which indirectly is your
entry to play pool as well. Overall, Diamonds is known for reasonable prices on both pool and
drinks.
Hours: Open 7 days. Generally 12:00pm–2:00am (they open by noon or early afternoon each day
and go until 2am). They also have a morning opening on Sunday for a brunch/lunch crowd (some
listings showed Sunday open 10am, possibly for NFL games). Essentially, it’s available for both
daytime and late-night pool.
League Nights: Yes – Diamonds hosts APA league matches on some nights (APA divisions often
alternate between Chips & Diamonds). It’s considered a “league bar” and can be packed with teams
during league sessions. They also advertise occasional small tournaments. Because of the league
traffic, Diamonds is a weeknight competitor to consider.
Food & Bar: Full bar with extensive drink options (they pride themselves on a variety of beers on
tap and specialty cocktails). The food menu is relatively extensive for a bar – typical pub grub (wings,
fried appetizers, sandwiches) and even lunch specials. Food and drinks are cheap to moderate – e.g.
domestic beer ~$3, mixed drinks $5–6. Many reviews mention “awesome” food and affordable
prices.
Vibe: Dive-bar meets pool hall. It’s an aged local bar with a horseshoe-shaped bar counter and
pool tables around. Smoking is allowed (expect a smoky atmosphere), and the crowd is a laid-back
mix of young and older adults. Regular live bands on weekend nights give it a bit of a honky-tonk
feel on those nights. Service is consistently praised – bartenders and staff (like “Michael” and
“Daniel”) know the regulars and create a welcoming vibe. The atmosphere is casual and
unpretentious – it’s the kind of place you’d find locals hanging out for hours. Because it’s smaller, it
can feel cozy but also crowded on event nights. Non-smokers might shy away, but pool players
who don’t mind often say this is their favorite hangout.
Google Rating: ~4.4★ (across ~200+ reviews). High marks for service, value, and fun factor.
Complaints, when they occur, are usually about the smoke or that the vibe “isn’t for everyone” (it’s a
bit of a dive).
Busiest Times: Weekend evenings (especially when a live band is playing) – then it’s standingroom-only and tables might be occupied for long stretches. Weekday league nights also draw a
crowd (if 2–3 teams are playing, most tables will be in use). Conversely, off-nights or earlier evenings
can be quiet, which is good for casual drop-ins. Diamonds tends to have a late-night rush as well,
since it’s open till 2am and some folks arrive after other bars or bowling alleys close at midnight.

Notable: It often doubles as a live music venue – few pool halls have bands, so this sets Diamonds
apart. They charge only a token cover for band nights, which keeps people coming in. They also
garner loyalty through personable staff (specific bartenders are mentioned by name in reviews) and
by being one of the only options in South Huntsville for both live music and pool. In short, Diamonds
carves out a niche as the friendly dive bar where you can shoot pool, rather than a slick
commercial pool room.
The Beer Hog (Madison) – new entrant
Tables: 8 pool tables (brand-new as of late 2025). They also feature other games: at least 2 dart
boards, a cornhole setup, and an arcade area with pinball machines. This makes Beer Hog a multiactivity venue. The pool tables are distributed around the space (which is quite large – it occupies a
former library building). Quality is high (new equipment) and there’s plenty of room around tables
due to the spacious layout.
Pricing: Beer Hog’s primary business is selling beer and food, so they haven’t heavily publicized pool
pricing. It appears coin-operated play (quarters per game) is available. Given the trend, they may
also allow table rentals by the hour, but user reviews haven’t focused on cost to play pool. Notably,
no cover charge to enter. We can infer pricing will be competitive (likely around $1/game or similar)
to encourage drinking and hanging out.
Hours: Open 7 days. Weekdays around 2pm–10pm (earlier close on weeknights since it’s in a quieter
area), and weekends open later (Friday/Saturday until midnight or later). Importantly, Beer Hog is
family-friendly by day – all ages are allowed until 9:00pm, after which it becomes 21+. This
approach differs from the purely 21+ pool bars and could draw in an early evening family crowd.
League Nights: Being new, formal leagues are not yet established here. However, Beer Hog has
started hosting other competitions (a foosball tournament, etc.). It’s likely they will partner with
leagues or start in-house leagues once they build a clientele. There is an opportunity for them to
host a BCA or APA league team in the future, especially given the number of tables.
Food & Bar: Craft beer focus – 60 beers on tap, plus 300+ in bottles/cans, according to their
promotion. This is arguably the largest beer selection in the area. They have a kitchen serving pizzas,
pretzels, and other bar food (the menu is akin to a brewpub). Reviews say the pizza is good and the
bar food is solid. Prices for beer are typical craft bar rates (perhaps $6–7 per pint), and food is
moderately priced (personal pizza ~$10, appetizers $7–$9).
Vibe: Modern beer hall meets game room. The Beer Hog (Madison location) opened in a converted
public library, giving it a unique open-floor layout. The atmosphere is bright, clean, and familyfriendly (at least until evening). Patrons describe it as a great place to bring kids early (there’s an
arcade room separate from the bar area) and also a cool hangout for adults later. Because it’s new,
everything feels fresh – from equipment to decor. No smoking inside (it functions as a restaurant).
They occasionally have events like trivia, karaoke, or even stein-hoisting contests. It’s worth noting
the location is a bit tucked away (not on a main highway), so they rely on word-of-mouth and social
media to draw people. So far, feedback is that it’s a “nice setup” with a lot to do in one place.
Google Rating: ~4.5★ (though still accumulating reviews). Early visitors laud the service, huge beer
selection, and the fact there’s “something for everyone” (arcade for kids, pool for dad, beer for mom,
etc.). Minor critiques mention that it’s not widely advertised and can be quiet on weeknights due to
the hidden location.
Busiest Times: Still ramping up – weekend nights have seen the biggest crowds. When events or
promotions happen (like an arcade event or a sports viewing), turnout increases. As one commenter
noted, they “need to advertise” to build consistent traffic. Expect that Fridays and Saturdays after

7pm are the peak, while weekday afternoons are slow. Family groups appear around early evening
on weekends. Given time, they may establish regular busy nights (e.g. a trivia night or league night).
Notable: Beer Hog’s Madison location fills a unique niche as an all-ages entertainment venue that
includes pool. It’s essentially a beer-centric barcade + pool hall. This differentiated concept could
attract a different segment of the market (e.g. craft beer enthusiasts who also enjoy games). Their
challenge is awareness – as a Reddit user observed, the location is slightly off the beaten path and
needs marketing. If they overcome that, Beer Hog could become a strong competitor, especially for
customers in Madison and West Huntsville who don’t want to drive into the city for a game of pool.
Other Notable Venues:
Aside from the major competitors above, a few smaller establishments within the area offer pool tables:
CD’s Pub & Grill (Madison): A local dive bar known for karaoke and a friendly crowd. It features a
small separate pool room with a couple of tables. It’s 21+ with a smoking-friendly environment. CD’s
is open daily 11am–2am. With a 4.6★ Google rating, it’s appreciated as a no-frills hangout. Pool is
typically free or coin-play, and league darts are also popular here. Food is classic bar fare and cheap.
Madison Station Bar & Grill (Madison): A bar and live music venue that has at least 1–2 pool
tables. It’s open evenings (closed Mondays) and has a large patio. The pool aspect isn’t the main
draw; rather, it’s an additional amenity. Madison Station has had mixed reviews for its service and
management. It caters to a late-night bar crowd; pool play is casual. Not a primary competitor for
serious players, but it’s in the radius.
Bishop’s Westside Pub & Grill (Madison): A neighborhood sports pub on County Line Rd. They have
a dedicated room for pool (with 2–3 tables and ash trays, separated by doors), allowing smokers to
enjoy a game without bothering those in the main bar. It’s open until 2am nightly, kitchen to 11pm.
The atmosphere is very local; on weekends it draws a crowd for karaoke or live music. Pool here is
more of a side activity, but it’s one of the few spots on the west side to play.
Sports Page Lounge & Deli and/or 19th Hole (Huntsville): These are older bar establishments (on
south Memorial Parkway) known historically for billiards. The “19th Hole” is essentially another name
that comes up at the same address as a past pool lounge. They would have a couple of tables each.
These have a very dive bar character and are likely frequented by a small set of regulars. They are
competitors only in a minor sense (limited tables, not well advertised).
Miscellaneous Bars: Many other bars in the Huntsville area have a table or two, even if not
branded as pool halls. For example, Maggie Meyer’s Irish Pub, The Thirsty Turtle, Copper Top,
Sidetracks Music Hall, etc., each offer 1–3 coin-operated tables alongside their main business of
food/drink or live music. While these aren’t primary competition for a pool-focused venue, they do
indicate that casual pool is spread throughout the nightlife scene. A new poolroom/bar should
consider that some customers currently get their billiards fix at these smaller venues – which
represents an opportunity to draw them into a better equipped, pool-centric establishment.
Sources for Competitors: Details have been compiled from official pages, user reviews, and local directory
info, including each venue’s own site or Facebook (for tables/hours) and aggregated reviews for pricing and
vibe .

Utilization & Guest Flow Assumptions
To model a new pool bar’s operations, we need assumptions on table utilization (what percentage of
tables are in use) and guest count per table during various times. The following table outlines typical
utilization rates observed or expected in the local market, divided by day type and time period, along with
average group sizes:
Time Period Weekday (Mon–Thu) Weekend (Fri–Sun)
Core hours (8pm–12am) ~50% tables occupied ~80% tables occupied
Late hours (12am–2am) ~20% occupied ~60% occupied
Avg guests per active table
– core
~2 people (duos common) ~4 people (larger groups on
weekends)
Avg guests per active table
– late
1–2 people (some solo practice or
couples)
~2–3 people (groups slim down
late)
Justification: On peak weekend nights, a successful venue should see 70–80%+ of tables in use.
Weeknights are softer; around half the tables busy in prime evening hours is a reasonable expectation,
dipping to only 10–30% late on a Monday–Wednesday. The blended average utilization across all hours
might land around 30–40% for a well-run hall. The group size per table tends to be higher on weekends
(friends out together) and lower on quieter nights (e.g. a couple on a date or individuals practicing).
Notably, local league nights can temporarily spike weekday utilization to near capacity for a few hours (with
teams occupying many tables), but this is one or two nights a week.
Guest Flow (Ramp-Up Curve): A new venue typically doesn’t hit maximum utilization on day one. We
anticipate a ramp-up period as awareness grows and customer loyalty builds. Based on typical bar launch
patterns and assuming strong marketing, one could expect:
Month 1: ~30% of target foot traffic (soft opening, word-of-mouth just starting)
Month 3: ~50% of target traffic (securing repeat customers, initial leagues forming)
Month 6: ~70–80% of target (momentum from promotions, possibly hosting league seasons by now)
Month 9: ~90% of target (business approaching stability, peak nights consistently busy)
Month 12: ~100% of target steady-state foot traffic and table usage achieved.
In other words, plan for a 3–6 month ramp-up to profitability with a new pool bar. The curve could be faster
with heavy marketing or a big unmet demand, or slower if there’s seasonality (summers might be slower,
for example). In Huntsville, a new venue might get an initial boost from curiosity, then a dip, then growth as
leagues and events take root. By one year mark, the goal is to have full league schedules, regular weekend
crowds, and maybe special events that maximize the venue’s capacity.
These utilization assumptions will feed into financial models (e.g. how many table hours rented, how many
drinks sold per night). They align with industry benchmarks (e.g. targeting ~50% average table occupancy
and >70% at peaks) and local anecdotal evidence (existing halls often have waits on weekend nights, but
plenty of open tables mid-week).

Recommended Defaults and Opportunities for a New Venue
Analyzing the gaps in the current market and the competitive data above, here are recommended
strategic defaults for a new poolroom/bar in the Huntsville area:
Smoke-Free Environment: A standout opportunity is to offer a 100% non-smoking venue (or a truly
effective smoke-ventilation system). Most competitors allow indoor smoking, which deters some
customers (note the complaints about smoke at Bumpers and Diamonds). While Chips & Salsa offers
a non-smoking section, no current pool hall is entirely smoke-free. Emphasizing clean air and a
family-friendly atmosphere before 9pm can attract health-conscious players and those who currently
have limited options.
Premium Tables & Equipment: Install high-quality tables (Diamond or Brunswick) and maintain
them diligently. Several competitors already use Diamond tables, so this is necessary just to be on
par. A differentiator could be offering both 7ft bar tables and a few 9ft regulation tables (only
Bumpers has 9ft tables currently). This would attract serious players (for straight pool, one-pocket,
etc.) while still catering to league players on bar boxes. Regular re-clothing, good lighting, and
professional cue rentals will position the venue as a top-notch pool hall.
Pricing Strategy – Value with Flexibility: Given local pricing, consider a hybrid pricing model: for
example, *$10 per hour per table (which is slightly above Steve’s/Diamonds rates) and $5–6 per-person
all-night wristbands as a promotion on certain nights. This captures both the casual groups (who prefer a
one-time cover) and the serious hourly renters. It’s important to remain in the general range of
competitors’ pricing to avoid driving budget-minded players away – e.g. Bumpers charges $8/person ,
Diamonds $6/hr, so our rates should feel familiar. Also consider daytime discounts* (e.g. half-price before
6pm) to draw in off-peak traffic.
Drink Pricing & Selection: Price drinks at standard bar rates or slightly lower to encourage longer
stays. For example, domestic beers ~$3 each, craft pints $5–6, simple cocktails ~$6–7, call liquor
cocktails ~$8–9. These align with local happy hour specials (e.g. $2.50–$3 beers) . A broad beer
selection (including local brews) and some unique house cocktails can set the bar apart. Also,
consider offering pitchers of beer – a value option that goes well with group play and isn’t offered
everywhere (Chips & Salsa has some limits on pitchers per a review). The goal: competitive drink
prices so the venue makes money on volume – keep people ordering that extra round because it’s
affordable.
Quality Food Program: There’s a gap in truly excellent food at a pool venue. Most rivals serve basic
fried bar food; only Chips has a full menu and it gets good feedback. A new venue could differentiate
with a better-than-expected menu: think gourmet burgers, fresh hand-tossed pizzas, or even a
signature appetizer that people talk about. This can drive non-players to come and helps capture the
dinner crowd. Position the kitchen as a kitchen + bar equal to the pool – not just an afterthought.
For instance, having a weekday lunch special could attract nearby workers (if downtown or near an
office park) and introduce them to the venue by day.
Location & Ambience: Location choice is crucial. Huntsville’s pool halls are currently not
downtown – placing a new one in or near the downtown entertainment district could tap into foot
traffic from other bars and events. Alternatively, an underserved area (e.g. the fast-growing
•
•
•

•

•
•

Hampton Cove/SE Huntsville, or Research Park/West Huntsville) might yield a captive audience with
little competition. Ensure ample parking regardless. Design the interior with a compelling theme –
e.g. an industrial chic “billiards loft” or a Rocket City (space-themed) sports bar vibe – to give it
identity. An upscale-but-casual decor with comfy seating, good music (not overly loud), and maybe
a mix of activity zones (darts, shuffleboard, etc., but pool as the centerpiece) will broaden appeal.
Essentially, create a place where even non-pool-players would enjoy hanging out (that’s how you get
larger groups in).
Leagues, Tournaments & Events: To capture the competitive players, quickly establish partnerships
with local leagues. Hosting an APA division from the first or second session after opening will
guarantee weekly repeat business – perhaps lure an existing division to your location by offering
incentives (e.g. free practice time for teams, or sponsor the league trophies). Additionally, introduce
a BCA league or in-house league for players seeking an alternative format – this could differentiate
from APA-only bars and attract the “serious” shooters. Regularly schedule tournaments (weekly or
monthly) with modest entry fees and prizes to create an ongoing buzz among skilled players. Don’t
overlook other events: perhaps corporate team-building events, since Huntsville has many tech
companies – a team outing to a pool hall with drinks could be a niche to market. Hosting charity
tournaments or cross-promotions (e.g. with local breweries for tap takeovers + pool contests) will
also raise the profile.
Operating Hours: Match or exceed competitors by being open 7 days and until 2am nightly
(standard bar closing time in Alabama). Given some competitors only open mid-afternoon on
weekdays, a new venue could open slightly earlier (say 11am or 12pm even on weekdays) to catch
any daytime traffic – especially if targeting lunch business or retirees. Keep an eye on Sunday hours;
opening by early afternoon on Sundays allows for a weekend afternoon crowd (families or league
players practicing). Essentially, maximize availability so that anytime someone gets the itch to play,
your doors are open.
Marketing & Promotion: Initial and ongoing marketing will be key. Avoid the trap of underadvertising – as we saw with Beer Hog, even great venues suffer if people don’t know about them.
Allocate budget for social media marketing targeting Huntsville and Madison residents, highlighting
unique features (e.g. “Downtown’s Only Smoke-Free Pool Hall!” or “30 Tables & Craft Cocktails – Now
Open!”). Engage local Reddit and Facebook communities (the Huntsville subreddits and Facebook
groups are active with bar recommendations) – perhaps host a grand opening event that gets
people talking. Do promotions such as free pool for an hour with a food purchase during the first
month, or league player appreciation nights with drink specials. As the business grows, institute
loyalty programs (e.g. a punch card for table time or membership that yields discounts) to retain
regulars.
Positioning – Emphasize Gaps: In summary, play up what’s missing in the market. For Huntsville,
that means touting a clean-air, high-class environment for pool (something for people who
currently avoid the smoky dives), excellent food and drink (so groups consider it as a dinner or
nightlife option, not just a pool hall), and perhaps entertainment diversity (live music or trivia one
night a week, arcade games, etc., but balanced so as not to distract from pool). On the flip side,
avoid being seen as just another rowdy smoky bar – that niche is filled. Also be cautious with pricing:
a super-premium $25/hour concept likely won’t fly here given local norms, so any upscale elements
must come without an exorbitant price hike. The sweet spot is “affordable fun in a nicer setting.”

By implementing these recommendations, a new poolroom/bar in the Huntsville area can capitalize on
unmet demand (for a non-smoking, quality venue), compete effectively on price/service, and carve out a
